## Project purpose
We created this app so students can replace their physical flashcards with virtual ones. This allows the student to spend less time creating study materials and more time studying. 

Our app has the following functionality: 

-	Create flashcards for your chosen subject
-	Access at any time
-	Update flashcards individually with new information
-	Delete flashcards (once you feel youâ€™ve mastered the knowledge!)

## Hosted Location
We plan to deploy our app to Heroku in the near future. More to come! 

## Technical Details
Core functionality is dependent on these resources:

-	Backend: Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/ 
-	Express https://expressjs.com/ 
-	Template Engine: Express ES6 Template Engine https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-es6-template-engine
